In reactor technology, uranium-235 is the isotope most commonly used.<sup class=\"ref-cite\" data-ref-id=\"1\">[1]</sup> A uranium-235 nucleus absorbs an incoming neutron, becomes unstable, and can split into two smaller nuclei (fission products), while releasing additional neutrons and a large amount of energy.<sup class=\"ref-cite\" data-ref-id=\"2\">[2]</sup> The exact products are probabilistic, but at least one neutron and energy are always released. One representative fission equation is:\n\n$${}^{235}_{92}\\mathrm{U}+{}^{1}_{0}\\mathrm{n}\\rightarrow{}^{141}_{56}\\mathrm{Ba}+{}^{92}_{36}\\mathrm{Kr}+3\\,{}^{1}_{0}\\mathrm{n}+Q$$\n\nThe energy first appears as kinetic energy of fragments and neutrons, then rapidly converts to heat in fuel, which is used to generate steam and electricity.<sup class=\"ref-cite\" data-ref-id=\"2\">[2]</sup> The source of released energy is nuclear binding-energy difference (mass defect), not a loss of nucleon count. Heavy nuclei become more stable after splitting, and the missing mass converts to energy via:\n\n$$E=mc^2$$\n\nAlthough each reaction has a tiny mass change, the large value of $c^2$ makes the energy release substantial.<sup class=\"ref-cite\" data-ref-id=\"3\">[3]</sup>\n\nNuclear waste is produced as a by-product of sustained fission and contains neutron-rich unstable nuclei that continue radioactive decay after fuel removal. Activity decreases over time as short-lived isotopes decay, while longer-lived isotopes dominate later hazards. Because waste emits both radiation and heat, shielding, cooling, and containment are essential.<sup class=\"ref-cite\" data-ref-id=\"4\">[4]</sup>",
