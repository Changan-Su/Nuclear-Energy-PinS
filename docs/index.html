When exposed to sunlight, electrons are dislodged from atoms and an electric current is created as electrons migrate across the cell.\n- An electric field is produced by dopants added to the semiconductor crystal lattice.\n- Silicon has four valence electrons; n-type dopants such as phosphorus (five valence electrons) donate weakly bound electrons and increase negative charge carriers.\n- p-type dopants such as boron (three valence electrons) create greater electron attraction.\n- Diffusion occurs when p-type and n-type silicon form a p-n junction; recombination and charge separation create an internal electric field and diode behavior, so current flows in one direction.\n- An inverter converts the original DC current to AC current for most electrical devices.\n\nSolar energy has variable output. In addition, the infrared part is not used to produce electricity, meaning PV cells use only part of available solar energy.\n\nSolar energy can be converted into electricity in different ways:\n- Direct conversion: voltage/current generated by photon absorption in a doped semiconductor (common for silicon solar cells).\n- Thermal conversion: heat converted into electrical energy by thermionic, thermoelectric, magnetohydrodynamic devices, or steam turbines.\n- Biological processes: growing crops (for example algae) and converting to methane for steam power; this route has low efficiency and requires extensive land area.\n\nPV panels are relatively low-cost to run, and rooftop installation can have limited impact on living conditions.",

Lift is stronger than drag, so the rotor spins. The rotor connects to a generator (through drivetrain components) and enables practical electricity generation.\n\nThe kinetic energy of a mass m with velocity v is:\n- $E_k = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$\nThe air mass can be expressed using air density and swept volume.\nPower is energy divided by time, and wind power scales with the cube of wind speed ($v^3$).\n\nSince velocity is cubed, wind that is twice as fast can provide roughly eight times as much power. This is one reason turbines are tall: wind is typically faster and less turbulent at higher altitude.\n\nTheoretical extraction is limited by the Betz limit (59.3%); in practice, turbine efficiency commonly falls in about the 34-45% range.\n\nDesign:\n- Rotor blades: airfoil behavior similar to airplane wings; pressure differences cause rotation.\n- Nacelle: contains gears and generator; gears raise low blade-speed rotation to generator-speed rotation.\n- Tower: supports nacelle and blades at a height suitable for stronger, steadier wind (often around 50-100 m).\n\nWind power is becoming an increasingly popular energy choice, particularly in the UK, with major planned offshore capacity growth.",

Cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low, making it competitive in many systems.\n\nA hydro plant generally includes three parts: an electric plant (generation), a reservoir (stored water), and a dam (flow control).\n\nWater at height stores gravitational potential energy ($U = mgh$). As water is released through a penstock, potential energy converts to kinetic energy and drives turbine blades. Turbine rotation drives the generator rotor and converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.\n\nHydropower also has trade-offs: river damming can disrupt ecosystems and migration routes, projects can require very high upfront cost, and some developments displace communities.\n\nGenerator physics:\n- Generators convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.\n- They operate on Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.\n- Electromotive force (emf) is induced when a conductor cuts a magnetic field.\n\nChallenges:\nHydroelectric generators can face vibration and temperature-rise issues.

          "detail": "More info:\n\nLocation:\n- The Earth is formed by three concentric zones: crust, mantle, and core. The crust and upper mantle form the lithosphere, split into tectonic plates.\n- Geothermal resources are concentrated in areas with higher heat flow, often near plate boundaries where hot springs and steam vents appear (for example, the Pacific Ring of Fire).\n- Heat also rises where crust is sufficiently thin.\n- Below the crust lies hot and molten rock (magma), with heat partly produced by radioactive decay of elements such as potassium and uranium.\n\nGeothermal energy is used directly (for example district heating) and in industry.\n\nGeothermal power plants use hydrothermal resources from dry steam wells or hot-water wells; extracted steam/hot fluid drives turbines to generate electricity.\n\nGeothermal plants can emit far less acid-rain-causing sulfur compounds and less carbon dioxide than similarly sized fossil-fuel plants.\n\nTypes of Geothermal Power plants:\n- Dry steam plants: steam from reservoir drives turbine directly.\n- Flash steam plants: high-pressure hot water is converted to steam that drives turbines; cooled condensate is reinjected.\n- Binary-cycle plants: geothermal heat transfers to a secondary fluid with lower boiling point; the secondary vapor drives the turbine.",

Both have roles in a zero-carbon future. Nuclear offers stable and reliable output, but with high costs and significant waste-management concerns. Renewables are among the cheapest and fastest-growing options, but still require progress in storage and grid integration. The best mix depends on each country's infrastructure, resources, and policy goals.",
