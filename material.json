When exposed to sunlight, electrons are dislodged from atoms and an electric current is created as electrons migrate across the cell.\n- An electric field is produced by dopants added to the semiconductor crystal lattice.\n- Silicon has four valence electrons; n-type dopants such as phosphorus (five valence electrons) donate weakly bound electrons and increase negative charge carriers.\n- p-type dopants such as boron (three valence electrons) create greater electron attraction.\n- Diffusion occurs when p-type and n-type silicon form a p-n junction; recombination and charge separation create an internal electric field and diode behavior, so current flows in one direction.\n- An inverter converts the original DC current to AC current for most electrical devices.\n\nSolar energy has variable output. In addition, the infrared part is not used to produce electricity, meaning PV cells use only part of available solar energy.\n\nSolar energy can be converted into electricity in different ways:\n- Direct conversion: voltage/current generated by photon absorption in a doped semiconductor (common for silicon solar cells).\n- Thermal conversion: heat converted into electrical energy by thermionic, thermoelectric, magnetohydrodynamic devices, or steam turbines.\n- Biological processes: growing crops (for example algae) and converting to methane for steam power; this route has low efficiency and requires extensive land area.\n\nPV panels are relatively low-cost to run, and rooftop installation can have limited impact on living conditions.",

Lift is stronger than drag, so the rotor spins. The rotor connects to a generator (through drivetrain components) and enables practical electricity generation.\n\nThe kinetic energy of a mass m with velocity v is:\n- $E_k = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$\nThe air mass can be expressed using air density and swept volume.\nPower is energy divided by time, and wind power scales with the cube of wind speed ($v^3$).\n\nSince velocity is cubed, wind that is twice as fast can provide roughly eight times as much power. This is one reason turbines are tall: wind is typically faster and less turbulent at higher altitude.\n\nTheoretical extraction is limited by the Betz limit (59.3%); in practice, turbine efficiency commonly falls in about the 34-45% range.\n\nDesign:\n- Rotor blades: airfoil behavior similar to airplane wings; pressure differences cause rotation.\n- Nacelle: contains gears and generator; gears raise low blade-speed rotation to generator-speed rotation.\n- Tower: supports nacelle and blades at a height suitable for stronger, steadier wind (often around 50-100 m).\n\nWind power is becoming an increasingly popular energy choice, particularly in the UK, with major planned offshore capacity growth.",

Turbine rotation drives the generator rotor and converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.\n\nHydropower also has trade-offs: river damming can disrupt ecosystems and migration routes, projects can require very high upfront cost, and some developments displace communities.\n\nGenerator physics:\n- Generators convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.\n- They operate on Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.\n- Electromotive force (emf) is induced when a conductor cuts a magnetic field.\n\nChallenges:\nHydroelectric generators can face vibration and temperature-rise issues.

The crust and upper mantle form the lithosphere, split into tectonic plates.\n- Geothermal resources are concentrated in areas with higher heat flow, often near plate boundaries where hot springs and steam vents appear (for example, the Pacific Ring of Fire).\n- Heat also rises where crust is sufficiently thin.\n- Below the crust lies hot and molten rock (magma), with heat partly produced by radioactive decay of elements such as potassium and uranium.\n\nGeothermal energy is used directly (for example district heating) and in industry.\n\nGeothermal power plants use hydrothermal resources from dry steam wells or hot-water wells; extracted steam/hot fluid drives turbines to generate electricity.\n\nGeothermal plants can emit far less acid-rain-causing sulfur compounds and less carbon dioxide than similarly sized fossil-fuel plants.\n\nTypes of Geothermal Power plants:\n- Dry steam plants: steam from reservoir drives turbine directly.\n- Flash steam plants: high-pressure hot water is converted to steam that drives turbines; cooled condensate is reinjected.\n- Binary-cycle plants: geothermal heat transfers to a secondary fluid with lower boiling point; the secondary vapor drives the turbine.",

These neutrons are used either to continue fission or, in designs with fertile material surrounding the core, to start this decay chain again to produce more uranium.\n\nOther designs use a similar method to recycle spent fuel from other reactors and from itself, as all actinides (elements usually found in spent nuclear fuel) can be used by an MSR, either within a breeder or the core itself<sup class=\"ref-cite\" data-ref-id=\"20\">[20]</sup> pg. 17.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Increased Passive Safety –&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;MSRs have various intrinsic safety features that LWRs cannot meet due to differences in design. For example, MSRs work at near-atmospheric pressures, meaning that if components become damaged, nuclear material is significantly less likely to be dispersed over a wide area. Also, these lower pressures mean the components are under less mechanical stress and so are less likely to catastrophically fail in the first place.\n\nAnother example is the properties of the salt: as it heats, it reduces the reactivity of the core, regardless of what task(s) it is performing. For example, as the salt expands with heating, the fissile nuclei are separated so fewer neutrons reach other nuclei at thermal speeds, and reactivity decreases. This gives MSRs a strong negative reactivity–temperature coefficient, providing higher core stability and allowing for passive reactor shutdown if the temperature rises too high.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Reduced / Less Dangerous Waste and Byproducts –&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;As mentioned, MSRs are able to make use of all actinide elements in some way or another, which are commonly found in spent nuclear fuel. This ability to use spent fuel means that the eventual waste/byproducts of MSRs are significantly less radioactive than those of other types of reactors. A consequence is that the byproducts of MSRs cannot be used as nuclear weapons at the same scale or effectiveness as LWRs or other reactors. The UK National Nuclear Laboratory produced a graphic demonstrating the closed fuel cycle that MSRs allow (MSR part in green).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Challenges surrounding MSRs –&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;While the base physics behind MSRs is understood and proven, their design complexity brings various engineering and technical challenges that have prevented the technology from being used on a larger scale. These challenges include –&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;- Reactor Longevity: Due to the corrosivity of molten salts, the pipes and other reactor parts are estimated to require replacement approximately every 5–7 years.&nbsp;</div><div>- Fuel Cleaning: Effective removal of byproducts is a major difficulty in MSR designs. For gaseous waste, the mixture of various byproducts causes standard filters to become clogged; more effective designs must be developed to prevent build-up and the resulting decrease in efficiency over time. For solid/liquid waste, the options are either to replace the salt as a whole, massively increasing the overall waste of the reactor (open fuel cycles), or to reprocess the fuel salt either in small batches frequently or in its entirety every few years, both with technical challenges for optimising fuel use and power generation (closed fuel cycles).</div>",

        {
          "question": "In a fission reaction, nucleon number is conserved. So why is energy still released?",
          "options": [
            "Because protons are converted directly into energy",
            "Because the fission products have greater total binding energy than the original nucleus",
            "Because neutrons carry away energy from the nucleus",
            "Because the uranium nucleus loses charge during the reaction"
          ],
          "answer": 1,
          "explanation": "The fission products are more tightly bound (higher total binding energy) than the original heavy nucleus. This increase in binding energy corresponds to a decrease in mass, which is converted into energy via E = mc^2."

            "Control rods stop absorbing neutrons completely"
          ],
          "answer": 1,
          "explanation": "When k > 1, each fission produces more than one subsequent fission on average, leading to an increasing neutron population. This causes the reaction rate and therefore power to rise."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is slowing down (moderating) neutrons important in most uranium-235 reactors?",

            "Slow neutrons have more kinetic energy",
            "Uranium-235 is more likely to undergo fission with thermal (slow) neutrons",
            "Fast neutrons cannot cause fission",
            "Slow neutrons prevent radioactive decay"
          ],
          "answer": 1,
          "explanation": "Uranium-235 has a much higher probability (cross-section) for fission when interacting with slow (thermal) neutrons. Moderators increase the likelihood that released neutrons will successfully trigger further fission."

          "question": "Immediately after fuel is removed from a reactor, why is its radioactive activity initially very high?",
          "options": [
            "Because the chain reaction is still occurring",
            "Because uranium-238 becomes unstable instantly",
            "Because many short-lived fission products are present",
            "Because control rods are no longer absorbing neutrons"
          ],
          "answer": 2,
          "explanation": "Short-lived radioactive isotopes dominate the waste initially. These decay rapidly, causing high initial activity, which decreases significantly as they decay away."

          "question": "Why did the graphite-tipped control rods contribute to the rapid power increase at Chernobyl?",

            "They absorbed too many neutrons immediately",
            "They temporarily increased neutron moderation before absorbing neutrons",
            "They removed the coolant from the reactor core",
            "They caused uranium enrichment to increase locally"
          ],
          "answer": 1,
          "explanation": "The graphite tips initially increased local moderation (slowing neutrons), which temporarily increased reactivity before neutron absorption took effect, contributing to the uncontrolled rise in reaction rate."

In order for elements to fuse, they must be superheated until all of the electrons are stripped away, and form a plasma. The nuclei then collide at such incredible speeds, the Coulomb barrier (electrostatic repulsion) is overcome, and the strong nuclear force causes the nuclei to become stable.<sup class=\"ref-cite\" data-ref-id=\"34\">[34]</sup> The energy from this reaction is then released as high energy neutron flux.",

Common types of magnetic-confinement fusion devices include tokamaks, such as the ST40 and STOR-M. The most important inertial fusion reactor is the NIF."

          "detail": "The way we quantify the effectiveness of a nuclear fusion reaction is with several values. Firstly, the nuclear cross section is a measure of the probability of 2 nuclei being able to fuse, $\\sigma = R/(\\Phi N)$.<sup class=\"ref-cite\" data-ref-id=\"35\">[35]</sup> Where $R$ is the reaction rate per unit volume, $\\Phi$ is the incident particle flux and $N$ is the target density. Maximising this number (by careful choice of reactant isotopes) is necessary for achieving nuclear fusion. We also use the fusion triple product to quantify a reactor's ability to fuse. The product of temperature $T$ (MeV), plasma density $n$ (m$^{-3}$) and confinement time $\\tau$ (s) is the standard value for measuring a fusion pulse.<sup class=\"ref-cite\" data-ref-id=\"37\">[37]</sup>\n\nIn order for fusion to be obtained at effective levels, the Lawson Criterion must be fulfilled:\n\n$$nT\\tau = 3 \\times 10^{21} \\text{ m}^{-3}\\text{ keV}\\cdot\\text{s}$$\n\n(For Deuterium–Tritium fusion).<sup class=\"ref-cite\" data-ref-id=\"36\">[36]</sup> Magnetic confinement uses long pulses (theoretically hours or days) at low density to achieve this, whereas inertial confinement uses extremely high plasma density, confined for short bursts."

          "detail": "As many people are aware, the famous Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear disasters, combined with the notoriety of the Manhattan project means that many people are afraid of nuclear energy. Nuclear fusion has many advantages to fission.<sup class=\"ref-cite\" data-ref-id=\"38\">[38]</sup> Fission involved moderating and controlling a violent chain reaction. However, if at any point confinement fails in magnetic fusion, the plasma cools and the reaction stops. Also, fusion facilities are operated remotely to reduce radiation exposure risk.<sup class=\"ref-cite\" data-ref-id=\"39\">[39]</sup> While the reactant, tritium, is radioactive (half life 12.3 years), the amount used in a fusion reactor is minuscule, and the product is helium, which is not radioactive. Neutron radiation would be harmful to human life, but while fusion reactors are active, they are operated and maintained remotely.\n\nThe binding-energy-per-nucleon graph shows the energy changes during fission and fusion. The difference in binding energy between the reactants and products is the energy released during a nuclear reaction. As you can see, the difference between a U235 fission and DT fusion is immense; the deuterium from one glass of seawater releases energy comparable to burning a barrel of oil.<sup class=\"ref-cite\" data-ref-id=\"40\">[40]</sup>"

        {
          "question": "What is a significant drawback of biological solar energy conversion (e.g., growing crops for fuel)?",
          "options": [
            "It has a very low efficiency of only 1% to 2%.",
            "It produces a DC current that cannot be inverted.",
            "It requires a vacuum to operate effectively.",
            "It can only be performed in spacecraft systems."
          ],
          "answer": 0,
          "explanation": "Most incoming solar energy is lost as heat or reflection during photosynthesis rather than being stored as biomass. Consequently, this method requires significantly more land compared to more efficient technologies like solar panels."

          "question": "If the wind speed doubles, by what factor does the total available power increase?",
          "options": [
            "2 times",
            "4 times",
            "8 times",
            "16 times"
          ],
          "answer": 2,
          "explanation": "The power available from the wind is proportional to the cube of the wind speed (v^3). The formula for wind power is: P_wind=E_kin/Detal t = DeltaV p v^2/2Delta t = rho A v^3 / 2"
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the \"Betz limit\"?",
          "options": [
            "The maximum height a turbine tower can reach (100m).",
            "The maximum theoretical efficiency of power extraction (59.3%).",

            "The minimum wind speed required to start the rotor."
          ],
          "answer": 1,
          "explanation": "Formulated by German physicist Albert Betz in 1919, this law proves that no turbine can capture more than 59.3% of the kinetic energy in wind. If a turbine were 100% efficient, it would stop the air entirely, meaning no more air could move through the blades to keep the turbine spinning."

          ],
          "answer": 1,
          "explanation": "To get Direct Current (DC), a split ring commutator is used. It acts as a mechanical switch that reverses the connection to the external circuit every half-turn, ensuring the current always flows in the same direction."

            "When the coil is stationary.",
            "When the angle of the magnetic field varies at its most acute point.",
            "When the number of turns is reduced to zero."
          ],
          "answer": 0,
          "explanation": "According to Faraday's Law, the induced electromotive force (emf) depends on the rate of change of magnetic flux."

          ],
          "answer": 2,
          "explanation": "The Earth's magma layer stays hot mainly due to the decay of naturally radioactive materials such as potassium and uranium. This process, known as radiogenic heating, releases thermal energy as unstable isotopes break down into more stable forms."
