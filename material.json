          "detail": "Sunlight is composed of discrete packets of energy called photons.\n\nMore info:\n- Photons have energy expressed by the formula $E = hf$, where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency of the wave.\n- Photovoltaic cells are composed of semiconductor materials such as silicon. When exposed to sunlight, electrons are dislodged from atoms and an electric current is created as electrons migrate across the cell.\n- An electric field is produced by dopants added to the semiconductor crystal lattice.\n- Silicon has four valence electrons; n-type dopants such as phosphorus (five valence electrons) donate weakly bound electrons and increase negative charge carriers.\n- p-type dopants such as boron (three valence electrons) create greater electron attraction.\n- Diffusion occurs when p-type and n-type silicon form a p-n junction; recombination and charge separation create an internal electric field and diode behavior, so current flows in one direction.\n- An inverter converts the original DC current to AC current for most electrical devices.\n\nSolar energy has variable output. In addition, the infrared part is not used to produce electricity, meaning PV cells use only part of available solar energy.\n\nSolar energy can be converted into electricity in different ways:\n- Direct conversion: voltage/current generated by photon absorption in a doped semiconductor (common for silicon solar cells).\n- Thermal conversion: heat converted into electrical energy by thermionic, thermoelectric, magnetohydrodynamic devices, or steam turbines.\n- Biological processes: growing crops (for example algae) and converting to methane for steam power; this route has low efficiency and requires extensive land area.\n\nPV panels are relatively low-cost to run, and rooftop installation can have limited impact on living conditions.",

          "detail": "How do they work?\n\nMore info:\nWhen wind flows across a blade, air pressure on one side decreases. The pressure difference across both sides creates lift and drag. Lift is stronger than drag, so the rotor spins. The rotor connects to a generator (through drivetrain components) and enables practical electricity generation.\n\nThe kinetic energy of a mass m with velocity v is:\n- $E_k = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$\nThe air mass can be expressed using air density and swept volume.\nPower is energy divided by time, and wind power scales with the cube of wind speed ($v^3$).\n\nSince velocity is cubed, wind that is twice as fast can provide roughly eight times as much power. This is one reason turbines are tall: wind is typically faster and less turbulent at higher altitude.\n\nTheoretical extraction is limited by the Betz limit (59.3%); in practice, turbine efficiency commonly falls in about the 34-45% range.\n\nDesign:\n- Rotor blades: airfoil behavior similar to airplane wings; pressure differences cause rotation.\n- Nacelle: contains gears and generator; gears raise low blade-speed rotation to generator-speed rotation.\n- Tower: supports nacelle and blades at a height suitable for stronger, steadier wind (often around 50-100 m).\n\nWind power is becoming an increasingly popular energy choice, particularly in the UK, with major planned offshore capacity growth.",

Cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low, making it competitive in many systems.\n\nA hydro plant generally includes three parts: an electric plant (generation), a reservoir (stored water), and a dam (flow control).\n\nWater at height stores gravitational potential energy ($U = mgh$). As water is released through a penstock, potential energy converts to kinetic energy and drives turbine blades. Turbine rotation drives the generator rotor and converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.\n\nHydropower also has trade-offs: river damming can disrupt ecosystems and migration routes, projects can require very high upfront cost, and some developments displace communities.\n\nGenerator physics:\n- Generators convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.\n- They operate on Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.\n- Electromotive force (emf) is induced when a conductor cuts a magnetic field.\n\nChallenges:\nHydroelectric generators can face vibration and temperature-rise issues. Uneven temperature distribution can affect insulation integrity and reliability. Thermal stress during startup/shutdown can contribute to failure risk, and thermal expansion can deform stator/rotor components.",
